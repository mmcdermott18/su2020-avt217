      <p>A: Two cats live in my house, a grey one named Lola and a black one named Riva.</p>
      <h2>Question 12</h2>
      <p>Q: What is your current favorite music album to listen to?</p>
      <p>A: One of my favorite artists at the moment is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/06nevPmNVfWUXyZkccahL8?si=80RjUU0GSW-KZX79H9gtGA">Gregory Porter</a>.</p>
      <h2>Question 13</h2>
      <p>Q: Who is your favorite graphic designer?</p>
      <p>A: Historically? Maybe Bradbury Thompson. Currently? I enjoy the work that <a href="http://theheadsofstate.com/">The Heads of State</a> and <a href="https://order.design/">Order</a> make.</p>
      <h2>Question 14</h2>
      <p>Q: Favorite music artist/band?</p>
      <p>A: I think the last full album I listened to was "i,i" by Bon Iver.</p>
      <h2>Question 15</h2>
      <p>Q: Favorite thing to do in quarantine?</p>
      <p>A: I like sitting on the couch and watching mindless movies? I don't know if that is my favorite thing but it is certainly something I enjoy doing. I also like going outside to make sure I get up and move around from all the sitting. That might be my health's favorite thing.</p>
      <h2>Question 16</h2>
      <p>Q: What's your favorite dessert?</p>
      <p>A:  Häagen-Dazs vanilla ice-cream with caramel sauce and crunched up honey graham crackers.</p>
      <h2>Question 17</h2>
      <p>Q: What is your favorite horror movie?</p>
      <p>A: I am not a big fan of horror movies so the list is small for ones I have watched. Rotten Tomatoes lists Zombieland as a horror (and comedy) so I would have to say that, Zombieland. Shaun of the Dead also lists horror as one of its genre's so that one is up there too. There is a zombie theme here but I think that is because of the horror part not because it is all I watch...</p>
      <h2>Question 18</h2>
      <p>Q: If you had to pick a superpower what would it be and why?</p>
      <p>A: At this exact moment, is being immune to getting or giving illnesses a superpower because that would be great right about now? If that doesn't count probably the ability to read people's minds. I think it would come in really handy with teaching.</p>
      <h2>Question 19</h2>
      <p>Q: Who’s your favorite character from a book, show, game, etc?</p>
      <p>A: Abed and Troy (from Community because I watched that relatively recently and someone else posted about it) are (two of) my favorite characters from a book, show, game, etc. I think their relationship in the show and their personalities was great and added a lot to that show.</p>
      <h2>Question 20</h2>
      <p>Q: Is if there is any type of specific art you like?</p>
      <p>A: I don't know if it is "specific" type of art but I enjoy screen printed posters whether they are for something (like <a href="https://www.dkngstudios.com/work/gig-posters">DKNG gig posters</a>) or more art based (like <a href="https://jonathanlawes.com/">Jonathan Lawes</a> or <a href="http://www.hereticheretic.co.uk/spectral-nation/artworks">Spectral Nation</a>). I like the poster format/size and I think the quality of screen printing is really nice with how colors are blended and overprinted.</p>
